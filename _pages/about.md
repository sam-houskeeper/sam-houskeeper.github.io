Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in political science at Columbia University. I study international political economy, particularly international environmental politics. My dissertation focuses on climate change as an international cooperation and bargaining problem. I am a methodological pluralist, but I specialize in quantitative empirics.
