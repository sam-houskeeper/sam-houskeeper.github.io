Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am a 5th year PhD candidate in political science at Columbia University studying international political economy. In particular, I study international environmental politics and my dissertation focuses on climate change as an international cooperation problem. I am a methodological pluralist, but I specialize in quantitative empirics.
