Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. My field of research is international political economy, particularly international environmental politics. I completed my Ph.D. in political science at Columbia University, where my dissertation focused on climate change as an international cooperation and bargaining problem. I am a methodological pluralist, but I specialize in quantitative empirics.
