Welcome to my personal academic website!

I am a Departmental Lecturer at the University of Oxford and a Tutorial Fellow at Exeter College. My field of research is international political economy, particularly the international politics of climate change and the environment. My work is theory-driven, and climate change relates to foundational debates on the prospects for cooperation, commitment, and stability in the international system. I am a methodological pluralist, but I specialize in quantitative empirics.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow (2024-2025) at Princeton University's Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance. I completed my Ph.D. (2019-2024) in political science at Columbia University.
