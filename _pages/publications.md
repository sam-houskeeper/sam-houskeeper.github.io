### State-Level Preferences for Climate Change Mitigation

Recent scholarship on global climate change mitigation has criticized the canonical interstate collective action approach as lacking empirical foundations and as inferior to domestic distributive politics accounts. I argue instead for a theoretically pluralist approach and provide empirical foundations for the collective action framework. Theoretically, I argue that a domestic account is neither mutually exclusive with an interstate account nor valid under rationalist assumptions without an accompanying interstate account. Empirically, I leverage a time series of national emissions to demonstrate that state behavior is consistent with rationalist state-level preferences and basic collective action predictions. This result is evidence that, despite the noise of domestic politics, state climate action can be partially explained by state-level costs and benefits and by the inter-state strategic environment, namely the collective action problem.
