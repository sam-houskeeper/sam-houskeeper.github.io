Some climate change mitigation has occurred despite the absence of effective international cooperation. National variation in observed mitigation may reflect varying climate national interest, which has received little theoretical or empirical attention in climate politics research. I argue that the interactions between state costs and benefits and state size, a proxy for invulnerability to free-riding, strongly predict observed unilateral mitigation. I derive this hypothesis and connect it to the extant literature on climate politics at multiple levels of analysis with a theoretical framework that interrelates state climate change mitigation interests, preferences, behaviors, and outcomes. I test the hypothesis by predicting the difference between real emissions changes and a novel estimate for counterfactual emissions changes. The theoretical framework and the counterfactual estimation methodology developed in this article will facilitate future work on climate mitigation politics, from both international and domestic politics approaches.



**Collective Reciprocity and the Failure of Climate Change Mitigation Treaties from Kyoto to Paris**

Climate change mitigation treaties have failed to attract significant participation beyond those states already inclined to cut emissions. Moreover, they have failed to elicit compliant increases in emissions cuts in participating states. I explain these failures by revisiting reciprocity theory, which forms the foundation of mitigation agreements negotiated thus far. These agreements rely on what I call ``collective reciprocity??, in which the impact of reciprocal defection cannot be limited to the initial defector. This form of reciprocity is weaker than what I call ``club reciprocity??, in which reciprocal defections occur through the denial of club goods and thus narrowly target the initial defector. While collective reciprocity is sharply limited in the depth or breadth of treaties it can sustain, climate change mitigation requires cooperation that is both deep and broad. I demonstrate the empirical failure of mitigation treaties based on collective reciprocity in two steps. First, I estimate the determinants of treaty participation, finding that local co-benefits to emissions cuts drove participation while an interest in climate change mitigation did not. Second, I evaluate the compliance of participating states by comparing their emissions trajectories to a synthetic control. This control is formed by weighting the emissions of non-participants by participation propensity, past emissions trajectories, and past economic trajectories.



**Environmentalism as Long-Term Good Provision: Evidence from Forest Conservation**
<!-- status in italics, draft link, appendix link -->

This article develops a novel institutional theory of long-term environmental good provision, particularly forest conservation. Long-term goods, or those for which payoffs are delayed or spread over time, are more likely to be provided by states with long-term institutions, or those with low discount rates and inter-temporal commitment mechanisms. Leveraging recent institutional theories, I argue that party institutionalization lengthens institutional time horizons while constraints on the executive allows inter-temporal commitment. Both features therefore predict long-term environmental good provision. Environmental goods are frequently long term because feedback from ecological systems creates tipping points or vicious cycles, meaning that current actions may be costless today but contribute to significant damage in future periods. Understanding the implications of the inter-temporal nature of many environmental goods is especially important because a large share of environmental goods, such as forest conservation, are not explained by traditional approaches which focus on public goods models for symmetric and non-excludable goods. I test my theory with cross-national time-series data on forest coverage, demonstrating that forest protection is not predicted by public goods theory but is well predicted by long-term institutions.
